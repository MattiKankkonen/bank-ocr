# bank-ocr
One way to solve the BankOCR coding exercise with Java.
This is my take on a coding puzzle found from here: http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataBankOCR
The basic idea is that we have a list of bank account numbers represented as rows of 9 LCD numbers. A checksum is calculated over the numbers to check line's validity. Input can be corrupted and checksum is utilised also for the error correction. More details can be found from the linked web site.
